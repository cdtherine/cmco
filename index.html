Anyone with eyes could tell what a draconian and fascist overstep this was. \n\n• He played Christmas music during Christmas, which - although you celebrate Christmas - you believed was probably religiously offensive to people who didn’t celebrate Christmas. What happened to separation of church and state? He was basically proselytizing in class. Why wasn't this guy in jail? Or - since you're a prison abolitionist - why wasn't he in a Norwegian rehabilitation facility? \n\n• He is a conservative. \n\nBut making children role play Apartheid is a new low, even for him.
